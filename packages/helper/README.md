# Dynamic Load

Utilities for dynamic load content for remotes, if you need to pre initialize it (in case of offline PWA for example)

## Install

```sh
npm i @embrapa/module-federation-enhanced-plugin-helper
```

## Usage

```js
import {
  loadRemoteAndModules,
  getModule,
} from "@embrapa/module-federation-enhanced-plugin-helper";

loadRemoteAndModules();

const module = getModule({ remote: "myApp", module: "./Component" });
```

## Features

### loadRemoteAndModules

This function load all needed and available for consumption, step:

- Get `remoteUrlMap` to know remotes
- Dynamic register by calling `getModule`
- List all remotes available for consumption using `moduleNameList` for each remote
- Load all modules for each remote
- Return all modules the app-shell, root-remote.

The scenario where we built this uppon was a scenario where the app shell only have remotes that only exposes what it is needed here. In our screnario, we need to offline install a PWA and cache all features, include remotes.
As many of then where being used im some sort of "lazy chunk load", "manualy" deal with ensure all ealy registration was being a pain.

With `dynamicLoad` we ensure all files needs for remotes are laoded and cached.

### getModule

Load a module from a remote using low level API, once dynamic import `impot()` dont work with dynamic passed names, as can bee read about [here](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/issues/1323)
